# grunt-crx[-new](https://github.com/volnet/grunt-crx)

[seealso: old version github](https://github.com/thom4parisot/grunt-crx)

`grunt-crx` is a Grunt task used to **package Chrome Extensions** (and soon, [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions)).

Chrome extensions can either be:

- **public**: *zip* files to be uploaded on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/);
- **private**: *crx* files to be signed with a private key and eventually self-hosted.

**Compatibility**: this extension is compatible with `node>12`.

**Migrating from `grunt-crx<1.0.4`**? Please head to the [Upgrading section](#upgrading).

## Getting Started

Install this grunt plugin next to your project's [Gruntfile.js](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) with the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev grunt-crx-new
```

Then add this line to your project's `Gruntfile.js`:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-crx-new');
```

## Documentation

This task is a [multi task](http://gruntjs.com/creating-tasks#multi-tasks), meaning that grunt will automatically iterate over all `crx` targets if a target is not specified.

### Target Options

- `src` (*mandatory*): ;
- `dest` (string, *mandatory*): the filepath of your `.crx` or `.zip` archive;
- `options` (object) – options that are directly provided to the `ChromeExtension` object;
- `baseURL` (string): folder URL where package files will be self hosted ([see Autoupdating in Chrome Extension docs](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate));
- `maxBuffer` (Number): amount of bytes available to package the extension ([see child_process#exec](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback));
- `privateKey` (string): location of the `.pem` file used to sign your `crx` extension.

## Configuration Examples

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  crx: {
    myPublicExtension: {
      src: "src/**/*",
      dest: "dist/myPublicExtension.zip",
    },

    mySignedExtension: {
      src: "src/**/*",
      dest: "dist/myPrivateExtension.crx",
      options: {
        privateKey: "~/myPrivateExtensionKey.pem"
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Advanced

This example demonstrates how you can tweak your builds upon your own
source architecture.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  crx: {
    myHostedPackage: {
      "src": [
        "src-beta/**/*",
        "!.{git,svn}"
      ],
      "dest": "dist/crx-beta/src/my-extension.crx",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://my.app.net/files/",
        "privateKey": "~/.ssh/chrome-apps.pem"
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Build Channels

This example demonstrates how to build separate channels of packages
within a same repository location.

Pretty handy to use a Git workflow and pre-release code before deploying it
in production.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  pkg: require('./package.json'),
  manifest: require('./src/manifest.json'),

  crx: {
    options: {
      privateKey: "dist/key.pem",
      maxBuffer: 3000 * 1024 //build extension with a weight up to 3MB
    },
    staging: {
      "src": [
        "src/**/*",
        "!.{git,svn}",
        "!*.pem"
      ],
      "dest": "dist/staging/<%= pkg.name %>-<%= manifest.version %>-dev.crx",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://my.app.intranet/files/"
      }
    },
    production: {
      files: {
        "dist/production/<%= pkg.name %>-<%= manifest.version %>-prod.crx": [
          "src/**/*",
          "!.{git,svn}",
          "!*.pem",
          "!dev/**"
        ],
        "dist/production/<%= pkg.name %>-<%= manifest.version %>-prod.zip": [
          "src/**/*",
          "!.{git,svn}",
          "!*.pem",
          "!dev/**"
        ]
      },
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://my.app.net/files/",
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Security Notice

It is strongly recommended to store your privates keys (`.pem` files) **outside**
the source folder of your extensions.

Although `grunt-crx` will exclude by default because [we do not want this story](https://it.slashdot.org/story/12/05/24/1717219/yahoo-includes-private-key-in-source-file-for-axis-chrome-extension) to happen to you.

## Upgrading

### v2.2.0

- It repair the problem [see `registerMultiTask` + `this.async` + `forget done()`](https://gruntjs.com/frequently-asked-questions#why-doesn-t-my-asynchronous-task-complete) , and [see the issue](Issues.md).

### v1.0

A few things have changed since `v0.3`:

- file selection now relies on the grunt [Task Configuration and Targets](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#task-configuration-and-targets);
- the `zipDest` and `filename` options are not used anymore: simply use `dest` with a `.zip` or `.crx` filename to automatically get an unsigned or signed archive;
- no file will be created temporarily on your filesystem – it is nicer for your disk and faster as well;
- file exclusion **now works** whereas it was broken between `v1.0.0` and `v1.0.4` and possibly harmful.

I present my **apologies** for the troubles you could have encountered if you have been using `grunt-crx@^1.0.0` until now.

## Contributing

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.

If you don't add unit tests, someone will take care of that before shipping the module to NPM.
Take any contribution as an opportunity to learn.
